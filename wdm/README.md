# Project Description

Outfit Planner is a digital wardrobe app that lets users upload photos of their clothing items, record price and brand information, and view their personal wardrobe collection.
It shows how seemingly harmless purchase data (like brand and price) can reveal sensitive patterns, like income bracket or location.

# Used technologies

Frontend

- React (Vite) — component-based UI
- JavaScript — logic and data handling
- HTML / FileReader API — for uploading and previewing clothing photos

Backend

- Python 3 + Flask — lightweight API server
- scikit-learn — for simple machine learning (Decision Tree / Logistic Regression)

# Features

- Upload photos of clothing items
- Add metadata (price, brand)
- View a wardrobe list of all items
- Send wardrobe data to backend for analysis
- Backend returns a predicted income bracket (Low / Medium / High)
